    <h1>AI Learning Journal</h1>
    <p>Documenting my progress as I tinker with things and mini projects</p>
    <h2>Day 0</h2>
    <p>
        <p> I wrote a few prompts on ChatGPT to develop a learning plan. I turned this into a PDF and uploaded it to NotebookLLM. I want to use this notebook to also keep track of any research paper/readings that I come across.</p>
        <p> I helped narrow down project ideas that I want to spend my time building using what I learn </p>
        <p> I created a git repo and a public facing page so I can publish my progress every week - to keep my accountable! Down the road I will consider if I want to get fancier and create a website.</p>
